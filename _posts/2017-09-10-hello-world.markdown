description: An introduction

Long, long ago in 1972, our ancestors developed a practice that would shape
modern programming as we understand it today. "Hello, World!" is perhaps the most
influential statement in the entire cosmos of code. It has adapted itself to every
dialect in existence, steadily evolving in both casing and punctuation.

"Hello, World!" symbolises the initial foothold a programmer takes when desiring to
conquer a mountainous language lying before them - a quest that can take more
than a lifetime to accomplish. Slowly, they begin to climb, ascending higher and
higher until they have a solid foundation in their language of choice -
all the while remembering, cherishing, that first step they had taken.

This post is intended to pay tribute to this ancient tradition. It is a post that
marks my first in a mountain of posts to come. The majority of my posts will be
related to personal projects, both to share what I'm currently working on and
also for myself to look back on in the future. I'm hoping to make most of my
posts fairly light-hearted, sprinkled with random bits of interesting trivia
to spice things up.

To start off with I'm planning on writing new posts every week or so but this
may increase or decrease depending on how busy I am with other things. Oh yeah,
there's also an [RSS feed][rss] if you're into that.

That's pretty much all I've got for this post, so "Hello, World!" and welcome
to my blog!
